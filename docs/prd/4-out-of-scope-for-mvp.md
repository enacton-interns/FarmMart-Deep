# 4. Out of Scope for MVP

To ensure focus on the core value proposition for the MVP, the following features and capabilities are explicitly considered out of scope. They may be considered for future versions of the platform.

*   **Subscription Boxes / Recurring Orders:** The MVP will only support single, one-time purchases.
*   **Advanced Logistics & Delivery Partners:** The MVP will rely on a simple, farmer-managed pickup/delivery model. A dedicated system for third-party couriers is not included.
*   **Dynamic Pricing Engine:** Farmers will set their own static prices.
*   **QR Code Traceability:** Advanced farm-to-table traceability features are not in scope for the MVP.
*   **Gamified Loyalty Programs:** Customer rewards, badges, and loyalty points are post-MVP features.
*   **Advanced Analytics for Farmers:** Farmers will have basic order information, but comprehensive sales dashboards are not included.
*   **In-App Chat:** The MVP will use basic order notifications (email). A real-time, in-app chat system is out of scope.
