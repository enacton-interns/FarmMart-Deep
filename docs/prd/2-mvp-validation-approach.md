# 2. MVP Validation Approach

The success of the Farm Market MVP will be determined by its ability to validate our two primary assumptions: 1) that farmers will adopt a simple digital platform for direct sales, and 2) that consumers will use this platform to purchase local produce.

Validation will be measured using a combination of quantitative metrics and qualitative feedback.

#### **Quantitative Success Criteria (First 3 Months)**

*   **Farmer Adoption:** Onboard at least **15** local farmers who actively list produce.
*   **Customer Adoption:** Acquire at least **200** unique customers who make a purchase.
*   **Marketplace Traction:** Facilitate a total of at least **$5,000** in Gross Merchandise Value (GMV).
*   **Operational Stability:** Maintain an order fulfillment rate of **90%** or higher.

#### **Qualitative Feedback & Learning**

*   **Farmer Interviews:** We will conduct 1-on-1 interviews with at least 10-15 of our initial farmers to gather direct feedback on the onboarding process, product management, and order fulfillment workflow.
*   **Customer Surveys:** A simple satisfaction survey will be sent to customers after their first purchase to measure their perception of trust, simplicity, and overall experience.
*   **User Feedback Analysis:** We will analyze all qualitative feedback to identify key pain points and areas for improvement in the post-MVP roadmap.
