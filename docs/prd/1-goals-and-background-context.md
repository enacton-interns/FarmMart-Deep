# 1. Goals and Background Context

#### **Goals**

*   Increase farmer participation by onboarding 50 local farmers within the first 6 months.
*   Drive customer adoption to achieve 1,000 active customers within the first year.
*   Facilitate $100,000 in direct farmer-to-consumer sales within the first year.
*   Achieve financial sustainability with a positive operational margin within 18 months.
*   Successfully launch in 3 distinct local communities within 2 years.

#### **Background Context**

The Farm Market application addresses the disconnect between local food producers and consumers by providing a full-stack digital platform for direct sales. Farmers face challenges with market access and profitability due to intermediaries and logistical hurdles. Consumers, in turn, struggle to find and purchase fresh, locally-sourced produce with confidence.

This PRD outlines the requirements for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of the Farm Market platform. The MVP is focused on validating the core assumptions: that farmers will adopt a simple digital sales channel and that consumers will use it to buy local goods. The solution prioritizes trust, simplicity, and community-building over complex, feature-rich technology to ensure it meets the needs of its target users.
