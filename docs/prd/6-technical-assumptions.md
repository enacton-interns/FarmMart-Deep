# 6. Technical Assumptions

This section documents the guiding technical decisions and constraints for the project.

#### **Repository Structure: Monorepo**

A monorepo will be used to house the frontend and backend code.
*   **Rationale:** This simplifies dependency management and cross-service changes during the early stages of the project, which is ideal for a small, focused MVP team.

#### **Service Architecture: Modular Monolith**

The application will be built as a single backend service (a monolith) but with strong internal boundaries between logical domains (e.g., users, products, orders).
*   **Rationale:** This approach provides a faster development start than a full microservices architecture, while still allowing for easier extraction of services in the future as the platform scales. It aligns with the MVP's need for speed and the long-term vision for scalability.

#### **Testing Requirements: Unit + Integration**

The testing strategy will require both unit tests for individual components and integration tests for key workflows (e.g., placing an order).
*   **Rationale:** This provides a balanced approach, ensuring individual logic is correct while also verifying that major components work together as expected, which is critical for a transaction-based platform.

#### **Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests**

*   **Frontend:** React with TypeScript.
*   **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js and TypeScript.
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL.
*   **Deployment:** The application will be containerized using Docker and initially deployed to a cloud provider like AWS or GCP.
*   **Rationale for Stack:** The brief mentioned React/Vue and Node/Python as options. I have proposed a specific stack (React/Node.js/TypeScript) because it allows for a shared language across the frontend and backend, improving development efficiency for a small team. PostgreSQL is chosen for its robustness and data integrity, which is crucial for handling orders and payments.
