# 5. User Interface Design Goals

This section captures the high-level vision for the user experience to guide the design and development process.

#### **Overall UX Vision**

The user experience should embody the project's core themes of **Trust and Simplicity**. The platform should feel like a friendly, approachable, and reliable local market, not a slick, impersonal e-commerce giant. The design will prioritize clarity, ease of use, and authenticity, using high-quality imagery of farms and produce to build a connection between the consumer and the farmer.

#### **Key Interaction Paradigms**

We will use familiar and intuitive e-commerce patterns to minimize the learning curve for all users. This includes:
*   A grid-based layout for browsing and searching products.
*   A standard shopping cart and multi-step checkout process.
*   Simple, clearly labeled forms for farmers to manage their products and orders.

#### **Core Screens and Views**

The following conceptual screens are critical for the MVP:
*   Home/Landing Page (featuring local produce and farmers)
*   Search Results Page
*   Product Detail Page
*   Shopping Cart
*   Checkout Flow (Payment & Pickup/Delivery selection)
*   Customer Profile & Order History
*   Farmer Dashboard (for order and product management)
*   Login / Registration Page

#### **Accessibility: WCAG AA**

The application must adhere to WCAG 2.1 Level AA guidelines to be accessible to users with disabilities.

#### **Branding**

*(Assumption)* The project brief does not specify branding. I propose a design direction that uses an earthy, natural color palette (greens, browns, yellows) and clean, highly-readable fonts. The brand's visual identity should be driven by authentic photography of the farms and their products.

#### **Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive**

The application will be a responsive web app, ensuring a consistent and functional experience across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
